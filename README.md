# Directions
Clone repository, open Unity, open Unity project, go to the folder where this repo was cloned, click on the VehicleShootingGame 
folder and click the "Select Folder" button. The project should open in Unity and create some more folders and files which aren't 
on the GitHub repo since the .gitignore prevents that. I created this using Unity 2018.4.19f1. If you have a different version, 
Unity should give you the option to convert to your version after you try to open the project.
